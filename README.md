You can add your new Issue [here](https://github.com/PBL-Pick-By-Light/Pick_By_Light/issues).


**When changes are made, check if other repositories are affected!**

Example:
In the backend repo, the attribute name in User entity is changed to username.
Because this affects the frontend, one should check the frontend repo before commiting the changes.
